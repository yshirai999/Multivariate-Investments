## Methodology

We model the marginal distribution of each ETF's return using the Bilateral Gamma distribution to capture skewed, heavy-tailed behavior.

Estimation is done via a differentiable tail-matching loss with Andersonâ€“Darling weights.

### Assets Modeled

Calibrated ETFs include:

SPY, XLB, XLE, XLF, XLI, XLK, XLU, XLV, XLY

Each assetâ€™s return distribution is modeled using a Bilateral Gamma density, calibrated to daily returns. Parameters are stored under BG_Modeling/estimates/.

The estimation procedure features:

+ Autograd-differentiable loss defined in PyTorch

+ Loss is computed via quantile-based scoring

+ Theoretical quantiles are derived from the BG pdf, reconstructed using torch.ifft from analytically known characteristic function

+ Tail-sensitive weighting based on the Andersonâ€“Darling criterion

+ Optimization via Adam, combined with backtracking line search for stability

+ Batch GPU implementation enabling high-throughput calibration:

+ Over 15 years of daily data can be fit in under 15 minutes on standard GPU setups for most ETFs

+ Achieves accuracy on par with and often exceeding classical Nelderâ€“Mead optimization

### Visuals (Optional Section)

(You can drop in a few thumbnails here if you want to showcase fit quality or tail calibration â€” let me know if you'd like me to prepare this.)

## Running the Code

### Set up environment

conda env create -f BG_Modeling/environment.yml
conda activate mbg-env

### Run calibration for SPY

python BG_Modeling/fit_BG.py --asset SPY --config config.yaml
ðŸ”® Future Work
Planned extensions include:

Copula-based joint dependence modeling (Gaussian, t, Clayton)

Implementation of Dynamic Saddle Programming to solve max-min optimization problem
