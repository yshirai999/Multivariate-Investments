# Backtesting Module

This folder contains the code responsible for evaluating strategy performance using historical data. It includes the core logic for executing dynamic strategies and measuring relevant performance metrics.

## Contents

- **Backteststing.py**: Implements the DSPBacktester class, which inherits from the DSPOptimizer class in the Optimizers folder; applies the optimized weights from the DSP procedure to historical asset returns to simulate portfolio performance over time.
- **run_parallel_backtest.py**: uses parallel computation logic to isntantiate several DSPBacktester objects and compute optimized weights for each trading day
- **analyze_performance.py**: Outputs key performance data and plots (e.g., rolling Sharpe ratios) for post-analysis.

## Key Features

- Supports dynamic allocation strategies (e.g., from DSPOptimizer)

- Incorporates a rolling window for simulating realistic strategy updates

- Generates comparison benchmarks (e.g., SPY Buy-and-Hold)

## Notes

The backtests assume daily rebalancing and self-financing strategies (weights sum to 1 and no cash injection). The strategy's 3-year rolling Sharpe ratio is reported in the root folder README and is visualized to assess the strategyâ€™s stability over time.

## Future Enhancements

- Add transaction cost modeling

- Incorporate multiple strategies with parallel tracking

- Allow benchmark flexibility beyond SPY
